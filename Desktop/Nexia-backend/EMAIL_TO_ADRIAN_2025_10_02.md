Subject: Backend Implementation Complete - Auto-login, Feature Gating & Billing Readiness

Hi AdriÃ¡n,

I've completed the backend implementation for the new user onboarding flow we discussed. Here's what's now live:

## âœ… What's Implemented

**Auto-login after registration:**
- Users get immediate access tokens and can explore the platform right after registering
- Verification email still sent, but no longer blocks initial access
- User object now includes `is_verified` status everywhere

**Smart feature gating:**
- Client creation now requires verified email + complete trainer profile
- Clear error messages guide users on what's missing
- Other features remain accessible for exploration

**Billing readiness signal:**
- New endpoint `/api/v1/billing/readiness` tells frontend when billing can be enabled
- Currently based on email verification, easily extensible for future requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact

- **Reduced drop-off:** Users see value immediately instead of waiting for email verification
- **Maintained security:** Critical actions still protected while allowing exploration
- **Clear progression:** Users get guided through verification â†’ profile completion â†’ full access

## ðŸ”§ For Nelson (Frontend Integration)

**Auto-login flow:**
- Use `access_token` from registration response to log user in immediately
- Redirect to dashboard with verification status banner

**Progressive banner system:**
- Show "Verify your email" â†’ "Complete your profile" â†’ "All set!"
- Use `is_verified` field and profile completion status

**Billing UI control:**
- Call `/api/v1/billing/readiness` to show/hide billing features
- Display appropriate messaging based on readiness status

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

- All changes are additive (no breaking changes)
- Registration now returns: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `user` object, `expires_in`
- Login allows unverified users but shows verification status
- New dependency `require_verified_and_profile_complete` enforces business rules
- Deployed to production EC2, health checks passing

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

1. Nelson integrates the frontend changes
2. Monitor user behavior and conversion rates
3. Ready to continue with SUBCRUD backoffice or catalogs/T&C when you're ready

The system is now ready for frontend integration. Let me know if you need any clarification or want to proceed with the next phase.

Best regards,
Sosina
